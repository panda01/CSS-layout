What I thought was an obvious solution and alternative to terrible grids that require extra markup,
and/or classes that the lazy programmer I am decided there has to be a better way, perhaps this is it.

This was expected to be run on a server that will show this dir and it's children when requested, a 
simple webserver.

Install sass command line, and then run `./dev.sh`. It will compile your stylesheet to `./dist`

Enjoy, and contributions are always welcome.

Some classes that we use in order to build a grid system
.container
.row >
	.col-desktop-6
	.col-mobile-9
	.order-desktop-1
	.offset-mobile-3


All classes follow the formula of {command}-{size}-{value}
where
command: col, order, offset
size: mobile, tablet, desktop, largetop
amount: 1-12


we also have some simple helper classes with a similar although different format

.display-none-mobile
