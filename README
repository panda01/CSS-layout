What I thought was an obvious solution and alternative to terrible grids that require extra markup,
and/or classes that the lazy programmer I am decided there has to be a better way, perhaps this is it.

This was expected to be run on a server that will show this dir and it's children when requested, a 
simple webserver.

Install sass command line, and then run `./dev.sh`. It will compile your stylesheet to `./dist`

Enjoy, and contributions are always welcome.
